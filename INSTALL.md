## Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually or want more control:

### Prerequisites

- macOS 12.0 or later
- Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3)
- Xcode Command Line Tools

Install Xcode Command Line Tools if you haven't already:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### Step 1: Build the App

```bash
# Create Xcode project (first time only)
./setup_xcode_project.sh

# Build and launch
make build
make run
```

Or do it all at once:
```bash
make rebuild
```

### Step 2: Grant Permissions

When you first run the app, macOS will ask for permissions:

1. **Accessibility Permission**
   - System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Accessibility
   - Enable the toggle for "MediaKeyControls"
   - Required to capture media key presses

2. **Automation Permission**
   - You'll be prompted when the app tries to control a browser or Spotify
   - Click "OK" to allow
   - Required for controlling playback

### Step 3: Install Chrome Extension (Optional)

The Chrome extension enables smart tab detection and playback state monitoring. **Highly recommended for Bandcamp and YouTube support.**

#### Install Extension:

1. Open Google Chrome
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top-right corner)
4. Click **Load unpacked**
5. Select the `MediaControlsExtension` folder from this project
6. The extension will appear in your extensions list

#### Configure Extension:

7. Copy the **Extension ID** (long string like `abcdefghijk...`)
8. Run this command with your extension ID:
   ```bash
   ./update_extension_id.sh
   ```
   Or manually edit:
   ```bash
   nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.bandcamp.controls.json
   ```
   Replace `EXTENSION_ID_PLACEHOLDER` with your actual extension ID

9. Restart the app:
   ```bash
   make restart
   ```

## Supported Browsers

The extension works with:
- ‚úÖ Google Chrome
- ‚úÖ Chromium

## Verification

After installation, test your setup:

1. **Check Menu Bar**
   - Look for the ‚ô´ icon in your menu bar
   - Click it to toggle media key capture

2. **Test With Spotify** (easiest to test)
   - Launch Spotify app
   - Play something
   - Press F8 (or Play/Pause key) - playback should toggle

3. **Test With Browser**
   - Open Bandcamp or YouTube in Chrome
   - Start playing media
   - Press F8 - playback should toggle

If media keys don't work:
